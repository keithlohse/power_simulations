# Power Simulations

This respository contains script files and supplemental materials for a variety of statistical power simulations that I have written. Specific scripts are detailed below, with links to supplemental materials (e.g., YouTube videos or published papers). 

1. "script_power_paired_t_test" - two repeated measures within a single group. Part of a series on statistical power for NASPSPA 2023, based on the paper by Cabral et al. PSE (2023) that is also stored in the repository. I build from this simple within subject t-test to a 2x2 mix-factoral ANCOVA and finally the full 2x2x2 mixed-factorial ANCOVA implemented by Cabral et al. 

2. "script_power_2x2_ancova" - two repeated measures, one between subjects factor, and controlling for baseline performance as a covariate. I use a factorial mixed-effects model to simulate part of the design of Cabral et al. PSE (2023). 

3. "script_power_2x2x2_ancova_Cabral" - two repeated measures, two between subjects factors, and controlling for baseline performance as a covariate. I use a factorial mixed-effects model to simulate the full design of Cabral et al. PSE (2023).
